These datasets are called upon by the "iNaturalist Data Summaries - Species Richness" and "iNaturalist Data Summaries - Jaccard Similarity" tabs of the ["Inspiring Eco-writing through Data Access" app](https://sara-stoudt.shinyapps.io/dodge_data/).

Note: ecology-data/stateYearList.csv is 61.39 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB. Will need to streamline this moving forward.
